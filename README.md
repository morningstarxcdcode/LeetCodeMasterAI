# LeetCodeMasterAI

LeetCodeMasterAI is a cutting-edge AI agent designed to solve LeetCode problems with human-like reasoning and precision. This project was created to push the boundaries of AI-assisted coding by combining advanced problem understanding, solution generation, and explanation capabilities.

## Why I Made This

As a passionate developer and AI enthusiast, I wanted to build a tool that not only solves coding problems but also explains the solutions clearly and estimates confidence in its answers. This helps learners and professionals alike to understand and trust AI-generated code.

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn advanced_leetcode_ai_agent.backend.main:app --reload
   ```
5. Use the frontend or API to submit LeetCode problems and receive solutions.

## Features

- Deep problem understanding with structured parsing of constraints, inputs, outputs, and examples.
- Advanced solution generation using heuristic and code synthesis techniques.
- Human-like, detailed explanations for generated solutions.
- Confidence estimation based on code analysis.
- Feedback processing and learning for continuous improvement.
